# Some of the relational operators used in bash are:
<<COMMENTS
==
!=
<
<=
> 
>=
COMMENTS

read -p 'Enter the value of a : ' a
read -p 'Enter the value of b : ' b

(($a == $b))
(($a < $b))

# Similarly we can write other relational operators as well.
# We will understand these operators better when using the if statements.
