# BASH SCRIPT
This is my new repository containing the stuff that I did when I started learning Bash Scripting.
### Intro.sh
  This is the first file which contains stuff about the following topics:
  - Bash Comments
    - Single Line
    - Multiline
  - Bash Quotes
  - Bash Variables
    - System Variables
    - User Defined Variables
